# Responsive-Portfolio
The purpose of this project was to learn how to build a responsive web page using media queries so I can design content for mobile devices, tablets and desktops.

We started with a desktop version and worked our way back.  I also went back and tried to standardize my portfolio with semantic tags that were lacking from the initial version and experimented with using rems.  Unfortunately I mistakenly started with smallest media query and thought using rems instead of pixels was preventing media queries from working.  After converting everything back to pixels (and rebuilding the page) I was sufficiently disappointed when they didn't work, becuase the last override takes precedence.

By the end of this the chrome developer tool and I were bros.
